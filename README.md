# Hacker News Top 10 Posts Bot
This is a simple Python Discord webhook bot inspired by [actions-bot](https://github.com/PhantomInsights/actions-bot). This bot will be hosted on Github Actions and takes advantage of Discord webhooks along with the [Hacker News API](https://hackernews.api-docs.io/) to automatically send top ten posts from Hacker News to any given webhook-integrated channel once a day.

The step-by-step tutorial can be followed [here](https://github.com/PhantomInsights/actions-bot), the only difference being how the information was fetched, as this bot was built for Hacker News.
